# Testing

## Running unit tests
- Update snapshots and run tests `npm test -- -u`
- Run tests without updating `npm run test`

## Checking code coverage
There is an html file that is generated when the test are run. Find this file:
 
 * Go to the directory that contains the project repository
 * Move to `\coverage\lcov-report`
 * Open `index.html` in a web browser

This will display line-by-line coverage of the current unit tests.
